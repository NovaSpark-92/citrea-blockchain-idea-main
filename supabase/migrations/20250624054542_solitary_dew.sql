  # Fix RLS policies for Privy authentication

  This migration updates the Row Level Security policies to work with Privy authentication
  instead of Supabase's built-in auth system. Since we're not using Supabase auth,
  auth.uid() will always return null, so we need to adjust our policies accordingly.

  ## Changes Made

  1. **Ideas Table Policies**
     - Updated INSERT policy to allow any authenticated request (since we handle auth in the app)
     - Updated UPDATE/DELETE policies to be more permissive for now
     - We rely on application-level checks rather than database-level auth

  2. **Implementations Table Policies**  
     - Updated policies to work without Supabase auth.uid()
     - Allow operations based on application logic

  3. **User Profiles Table Policies**
     - Updated to work without Supabase auth dependency

  ## Security Notes
  
  Since we're not using Supabase's built-in authentication, we're making the policies
  more permissive at the database level and relying on application-level security.
  This is acceptable since:
  - Privy handles the authentication
  - The application validates user permissions before making database calls
  - We still have RLS enabled for basic protection

-- Note: We keep the existing SELECT policies as they already allow public read access
